# RadioFluxTools

Measure flux density of radio sources in radio images, using polygon regions and circular apertures.
 
## Installation
Installation can be done in the usual way, e.g.
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/Sunmish/radiofluxtools.git
cd radiofluxtools/
pip install .
```
## Usage
A command line interface, `flux_density.py', is installed for convenience, but the functions can also be used as needed within other code.

```
usage: flux_density.py [-h] [-r REGION] [-c COORDS COORDS] [-R RADIUS] [-i R_INDEX] [-s SIGMA] [-p PSFIMAGE] [-F] [-B] [-v] [-o OUTNAME]
                       [-A]
                       fitsimage rms

Measure the integrated flux density within a region of an image. Four values are printed: 
integrated flux density, uncertainty on the integrated flux density, peak flux density, 
and peak flux density uncertainty.

positional arguments:
  fitsimage             FITS image to measure flux density from.
  rms                   Either name of FITS image of spatially varying rms noise or a single value.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -r REGION, --region REGION
                        Name of a region file containing polygon and/or circle regions to measure.
  -c COORDS COORDS, --coords COORDS COORDS
                        Centre RA, DEC of aperture to measure if not using a region file.
  -R RADIUS, --radius RADIUS
                        Radius of aperture to measure if not using a region file.
  -i R_INDEX, --r_index R_INDEX
                        Row index in region file of region to measure. 
                        0-indexed (i.e. row 0 is the first row). [Default 0]
  -s SIGMA, -t SIGMA, --sigma SIGMA, --threshold SIGMA
                        SNR to mask pixels. Pixels below `sigma`*`rms` are set to NaN. [Default 3]
  -p PSFIMAGE, --psfimage PSFIMAGE
                        PSF cube describing a spatially varying PSF. 
                        Default is to use the BMAJ, BMIN from the FITS image.
  -F, --full_region_error
                        Determine measurement error from the full region rather 
                        than just the measured pixels. This should generally be
                        used but may overestimate the error if there are many 
                        blanked pixels within the measured region.
  -B, --blob_correct
  -v, --verbose         Print out measurements in a more human-readable form.
  -o OUTNAME, --outname OUTNAME
                        Set an output image name to write out an image with everything NaN except 
                        for measured pixels (e.g. to check region and sigma threshold).
  -A, --all             Measure all regions in a given region file. If --verbose is used, then 
  			all components are printed them summed at the end.
